   :class: floatingarcher

Welcome to Archer's documentation.  This documentation is divided into
different parts.  I recommend that you get started with
:ref:`installation` and then head over to the :ref:`quickstart`.
Besides the quickstart, there is also a more detailed :ref:`tutorial` that
shows how to create a complete (albeit small) application with Archer.  If
you'd rather dive into the internals of Flask, check out
the :ref:`api` documentation.  Common patterns are described in the
:ref:`patterns` section.

Archer depends on two external libraries: the `thriftpy`_ interpreter
engine and the `click`_ cli parser.  These libraries are not documented
here.  If you want to dive into their documentation, check out the
following links:

-   `Thriftpy Documentation <https://thriftpy.readthedocs.org/en/latest>`_
-   `Click Documentation <http://click.pocoo.org>`_
